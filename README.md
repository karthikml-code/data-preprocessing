Data preprocessing templates for ML models.

Libraries used are as follows:

numpy - for data manipulation.

pandas - for data reading.

SimpleImputer - to take care of the missing data in the dataset.

OneHotEncoder - for categorical encoding in the feature or independent variable.

LableEncoder - for encoding the dependent variable(y).

train_test_split - to split the data into train set and test set.

StandardScaler - for feature scaling. This is important for most of the machine learning models like SVM, etc..
